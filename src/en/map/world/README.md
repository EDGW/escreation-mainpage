      - title: <font color="white">This web map has poor compatibility</font>
        details: <font color="white">Although Bluemap is a web map with extensive mod compatibility, it is not able to render blocks that require special rendering, so belts, pipes, cogwheels and so many kinetic blocks of Create, GregTech's veins, ores, as well as many decorative blocks, may not be rendered or may be rendered as missing textures (or purple and black colored blocks).</font>
