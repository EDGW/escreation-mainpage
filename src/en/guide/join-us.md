 - When a server owner or administrator asks you for your account, you should only send them your account, not your password;
 - When the software reports an error page that says "Please do not send a screenshot of this page to others", you will not send a screenshot of the page to others, but will read the software's instructions and seek help from others in the right way;
 - When you enter our QQ group, you will read the group announcement, understand the server rules and how to enter the server, you will not post a lot of meaningless content or brush the screen with oversized emoticons, you will not repeatedly ask other people questions that have been answered by the group announcement, and you will be kind to other people when you ask them;
